# SigResult
SigResult is a web app that enables users to make their own custom signal waveform. Users can add components to their signal and specify the parameters of the components to change how the signal looks.

# Why?
While doing my Signals and Linear Systems homework, I found adding all the component signals an unnecessary hassle. So I made a tool to do it for me!
